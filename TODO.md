# Animations
- (start menu) set static position instead of using mouse attach (configure in settings)
- add back panel revealer animation based on y/x position instead of adjusting shape dimensions (for brief notifications)

# Config System
- ~~Migration system, like how databases have it i think, automatically migrate configs and upgrade them
to add new defaults without impacting already stored values~~

# Notifications
- ~~Small notifications based on samsung brief notifswhen a fullscreen window is focused~~

# Wallpaper
- ~~Use a default wallpaper if the current set wallpaper is missing (to avoid error)~~
